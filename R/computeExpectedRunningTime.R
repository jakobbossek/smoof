#' Compute the Expected Running Time (ERT) performance measure.
#'
#' @description
#' The functions can be called in two different ways
#' \itemize{
#'   \item{1. Pass a vector of function evaluations and a logical vector which
#'   indicates which runs were successful (see details).}
#'   \item{2. Pass a vector of function evaluation, a vector of reached target
#'   values and a single target value. In this case the logical vector of
#'   option 1. is computed internally.}
#' }
#'
#' @details The Expected Running Time (ERT) is one of the most popular performance
#' measures in optimization. It is defined as the expected number of function
#' evaluations needed to reach a given precision level, i.e., to reach a certain
#' objective value for the first time.

#' @param fun.evals [\code{numeric}]\cr
#'   Vector containing the number of function evaluations.
#' @param fun.success.runs [\code{logical}]\cr
#'   Boolean vector indicating which algorithm runs were successful,
#'   i.e., which runs reached the desired target value. Default is \code{NULL}.
#' @param fun.reached.target.values [\code{numeric} | \code{NULL}]\cr
#'   Numeric vector with the objective values reached in the runs. Default is
#'   \code{NULL}.
#' @param fun.target.value [\code{numeric(1)} | \code{NULL}]\cr
#'   Target value which shall be reached. Default is \code{NULL}.
#' @param penalty.value [\code{numeric(1)}]\cr
#'   Penalty value which should be returned if none of the algorithm runs
#'   was successful. Default is \code{Inf}.
#' @return [\code{numeric(1)}]
#'   Estimated Expected Running Time.
