\title{Generator for function with multiple peaks following the multiple peaks model 2.}
\usage{
makeMPM2Function(
  n.peaks,
  dimensions,
  topology,
  seed,
  rotated = TRUE,
  peak.shape = "ellipse",
  evaluation.env = "R"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{n.peaks}{[\code{integer(1)}]\cr
Desired number of peaks, i. e., number of (local) optima.}

\item{dimensions}{[\code{integer(1)}]\cr
Size of corresponding parameter space.}

\item{topology}{[\code{character(1)}]\cr
Type of topology. Possible values are \dQuote{random} and \dQuote{funnel}.}

\item{seed}{[\code{integer(1)}]\cr
Seed for the random numbers generator.}

\item{rotated}{[\code{logical(1)}]\cr
Should the peak shapes be rotated? This parameter is only relevant in case
of elliptically shaped peaks.}

\item{peak.shape}{[\code{character(1)}]\cr
Shape of peak(s). Possible values are \dQuote{ellipse} and \dQuote{sphere}.}

\item{evaluation.env}{[\code{character(1)}]\cr
Evaluation environment after the function was created. Possible
(case-insensitive) values are \dQuote{R} (default) and \dQuote{Python}. The
original generation of the problem is always done in the original Python
environment. However, evaluation in R is faster, especially if multiple
MPM2 functions are used in a multi-objective setting.}
